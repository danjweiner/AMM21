# AMM21
`AMM` is a command-line tool to run the Abstract Mediation Model on your own device (Weiner et al 2021, biorxiv).

## Overview

`AMM` estimates two quantities:
1) p(k): The fraction of heritability mediated by the kth-closest gene
2) e(A): Mediated heritability enrichment of a gene set

What you need to provide for estimation:
1) GWAS summary statistics
2) Gene sets for either 1) learning p(k) or 2) estimation of e(A)

## Getting started

You'll need to download this repository to access AMM.py, which contains the functions to run AMM. To download this repository, run:
```  
git clone https://github.com/danjweiner/AMM21.git
